# Chapter 1. Introduction

MacPorts is an easy to use system for compiling, installing, and managing open source software. MacPorts can be divided into two main parts:
- The infrastructure (MacPorts base)
- The set of available ports

## Key Features

MacPorts offers several advantages:

- Automatically installs required dependencies
- Provides uninstall and upgrade capabilities
- Confines ported software to a private "sandbox"
- Allows creation of pre-compiled binary installers

## Platform Support

MacPorts is developed on macOS but is designed to be portable to other Unix-like systems. However, port installation currently only works on macOS.

## Notational Conventions

The guide uses the following conventions:

- Terminal input/output:
  ```
  $ Command output to a terminal window
  ```

- Special text types:
  - Hyperlinks: [example link](https://example.com)
  - Files: `/path/to/file`
  - Commands: **command name**
  - Options: `port install`
